we have studied electric field in the last section . it is a vector quantity and can be represented as we represent vectors . this is because the magnitude of electric field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the distance of that point from the charge . the vector gets shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing radially outward . we also get many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point charge, resulting in well-separated lines . if ..
